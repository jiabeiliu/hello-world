            <strong><em><p>I am Jiabei Liu, an enthusiastic and driven Master of Science student in information system at Northeastern University. With a deep-seated passion for technology and innovation, I am dedicated to honing my skills in software development. My academic path has armed me with extensive knowledge in diverse programming languages like Java, Python, JavaScript, and HTML, and my hands-on experience with SQL has been instrumental in contributing to real-world projects.
My educational journey bridges two diverse fields – starting with Architectural Engineering from China University of Petroleum, leading to a passion for software engineering. This unique combination has equipped me with a broad perspective and innovative approach to problem-solving.
In my previous role as an Architectural Designer at China State Construction, I led several building design projects, where I skillfully integrated machine learning in architectural research. This experience underlines my capability to blend technical proficiency with creative design.
In the dynamic realm of computer science, I excel at addressing complex challenges and devising creative solutions. My fervor lies in software development, and I am actively seeking internships and collaborative opportunities to apply my skills practically and make a significant impact in the tech industry.
I am keen on connecting with like-minded individuals, industry experts, and mentors to exchange ideas, stay abreast of the latest technological trends, and explore potential collaborations. If you share a zeal for computer science and innovation, I welcome the opportunity to connect and contribute to the evolving landscape of technology together.
Feel free to reach out for discussions on tech, collaborations, or just to expand our professional network. I am excited to embark on this journey and make a meaningful contribution to the field of computer science.</p>
